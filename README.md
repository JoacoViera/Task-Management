# 💻Task Management App [![saythanks](https://img.shields.io/badge/say-thanks-ff69b4.svg)](https://saythanks.io/to/JoacoViera) 


My first React project 😍!

![alt tag](img/example.jpg)

It contains some bugs, like add new empty tasks and duplicated for example.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
