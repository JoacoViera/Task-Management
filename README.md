# 💻Tasks Management App [![saythanks](https://img.shields.io/badge/say-thanks-ff69b4.svg)](https://saythanks.io/to/JoacoViera) 


My first React project 😍!

![alt tag](img/example.jpg)

It contains some bugs, like add new empty tasks and duplicated for example.

## How to run the project ?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


First run the following command to install all node modules.

### `npm install`

Then just write this in your command prompt to run the project in your localhost on port 3000:

### `npm start`


## Oh, thanks!
